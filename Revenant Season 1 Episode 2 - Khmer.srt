Jung Hyunji.

Eat slowly, Hyunji.

Is everything over now?

Not for you.

The evil spirit is still latched onto you.

244
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,594
No.

245
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,722
There's no such thing as ghosts.

246
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,142
Humans are more terrifying than ghosts.

247
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,187
Hyunwoo and Jinwook died
because of evil people

248

Your stress level is extremely high.

258
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,477
You're not sleeping much either.

259
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,564
It's highly likely
that you may hallucinate or hear things.

260
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:45,527
My mother has been suffering
from anxiety disorder for a long time.

261
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,946
Could that have affected me?

262
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,657
If a close family member
has a long-standing medical condition,

263
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,284
it could be one of the factors
causing your stress.

264
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,871
[doctor] But the hereditary aspect of it
hasn't been scientifically proven yet.

I'll prescribe you some medication.

266

Let's see if it improves your condition.

267
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,462
Do you believe in ghosts, Doctor?

268
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,968
I mean…

269
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,513
Do you think ghosts exist?

270
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,641
You could have hallucinated
in your susceptible condition,

271
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:16,934
but they are not real.

272
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,103

You tell people about the things you see,
but they think you're insane.

You've finally found

Why do you think he did it?

305
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,867
He wrote a letter to you, a stranger,
asking you to protect his daughter.

306

Despite never meeting you
when you asked him to.

307

Plus, he knew that an evil spirit
would latch onto his daughter.

How did he know that?

We'll find out once we figure out
why that evil spirit...

Your mother has already passed away.

312
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,892
Why are you trying to catch it
when doing so won't change anything?

314
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,443
It could get more painful.

Who was he?

729
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,578
Professor Gu Gangmo, her father.

730
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,288
He committed suicide recently,

731
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,207
and his wrists were also bruised.

You think Gu Sanyeong is the culprit
of these cases as well?

734
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:49,598
Based on the circumstances,
suicide is highly likely in both cases.

735
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,852
Let's look for more ordinary
and decent cases

736
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,437
instead of cases like these.

737
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,610
Do you want to solve a decent case
and receive a promotion?

738
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,822
What? What do you mean?

739
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,533
Rumor has it that you're desperate
for a promotion.

740
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,159

It's normal to want a promotion.

Pardon?

744
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:17,125
Who doesn't like a good promotion?

745
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,087
I was desperate for one too.

746
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,965
I just wasn't competent enough.

747
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,300
So…

748
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,804
Let's give this case a try.

-Yes.
-What for?

758
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:57,124
We got a call about a fire
at a small bed and breakfast in 1995.

<i>We found a deceased woman
in that building.</i>

761
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,594
<i>She had hung herself on a ridgepole.</i>

762
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:13,056
<i>There were red bruises
on the victim's wrists.</i>

[young Munchun] Did she come here alone?

No, she was with her young son.

-[officer 2] Carry him.
-He also said that it wasn't suicide.

770
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,875
He was very young.
Maybe he remembered it differently.

771
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,628
That's what I thought as well.

772
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,546

[Munchun] <i>The suspect disappeared

774
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,053
In the end, we never found them.

775
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,015
After all, there weren't many
surveillance cameras back then.

776
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:59,311
Then was this your first case?

777
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:01,647
Correct.

778
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,483
I was inexperienced

779
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:06,818

But these cases continued to occur.

782
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,871
There have been similar cases
for a long time now.

783
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,832
So why don't we try...

So how will we possibly solve them now?

789
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,683
I'm sure there were cases
that we overlooked.

Let's scan through all the suicide cases
and find a similarity in them.

Sir. Korea has the highest suicide rate
among all OECD member countries.

Are you saying we should look
through all those cases?

00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,954
After she passed away,

926
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,998
the red hair accessory disappeared.

927
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,793
[Haesang] While searching for the object,

928
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,797
I came across your father's works.

929
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,549
He wrote...

930
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,093
all of these?

931
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,845
Correct.

00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,395
WHEN THE SYMPTOMS GET WORSE,
THEY ROAM THE MOUNTAINS

933
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,897
[Haesang] But no one believed him.

934
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,776
Even the academic world ostracized him

935
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:53,196
for writing such groundless nonsense.

936
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,406
But he continued to publish works

937
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,284
regarding evil spirits until he retired.

938
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,747
[Sanyeong]
"A shadow that lets its hair loose."

939
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,252
That's right.

940
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,504
It's the embodiment of the evil spirit.

941
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:13,091
Professor Gu knew about this evil spirit.

942
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,722

<i>"A shadow that lets its hair loose</i>

944
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:27,188
I visited him as soon as I saw his works,

945
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,065
but he had already retired by then.

946
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,109
I tried numerous times to meet with him.

[Haesang] I don't know why,

949
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,030
but he refused to see me.

950
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:41,286
I had no choice but to do my own research
based on his works.

951
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,706
But I couldn't find the sources.

952
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,458
It was impossible to find anything
based on his works alone.

953
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,252
Then does that mean

954
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,589
you haven't found out anything
about the evil spirit?

955
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,215
As of now, yes.

956
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:02,015
Once we find out how your father
got hold of this,

957
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,183
we'll be able to learn more
about the evil spirit.

958
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,109
I saw a strange notebook.

959
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,028
What do you mean?

960
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:18,948
I saw it.

961
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,539

Don't blame yourself.

966
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:45,600
It was the evil spirit
who murdered her, not you.

967
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,814
Do you remember…

968
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,526

It's not on the map either.

980

Like we did with Hyunwoo,

986
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:00,425
can we get rid of the evil spirit
once we find out its name and story?

987

I told you. Every ghost is different.
