[bystander 2] There's an invisible hand
behind suicide cases.

101
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,249
There's a regulation
for "death by intimidation" in Article 322

102
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,835
of the early Joseon Dynasty legal book

It's an expensive lecture, so listen up.

00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,385
"Death by intimidation"

107
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,763
was a law made for those
who were threatened and persecuted

108
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:15,101
and took their lives when the feeling
of injustice became too much to bear.

109
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:20,106
It took revenge
on those who caused their death.

110
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,733
They thought there was an invisible hand,

111

112
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:29,073

over injustices now and in the past.

What is this?

546
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,678
<i>I'm Yeom Haesang,
a professor at Jeyoung University.</i>

547
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,763
<i>Please contact me.</i>

548
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:20,099
Why do I keep getting this?
Is it a new type of voice phishing?

549
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:27,774
It's just a few stones.
How can this be a cultural asset?

550
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,358
Is it really from the Joseon Dynasty?

551
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:33,154
There's no other artifact around here,
so it's highly unlikely.

552
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,115
But an expert should be here soon.
Please wait a little longer.

553
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,117
Oh, that must be him.

- It's the food delivery.

- Yes, on my way!

00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,887
You're that guy from before, right?

558
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,473
- Why haven't you contacted me?
- What?

559
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,267
I sent you several texts.
Why have you still not contacted me?

560
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,938
You're Professor Yeom Haesang
from Jeyoung University?

561

How did you get my number?

562
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,275
[official] Professor, over here.

563
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,238
I guess we were destined to meet again

564
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,614
even though it may be ill-fated.

565
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,032
What is he saying?

566
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,910
I asked you how you got my number.

567
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,704
Wait one moment, please.
There's something we need to talk about.

568
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,250
He leaves after saying his piece without
answering other people's questions.

569
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,002
[worker] Aren't you going
to give me my lunch?

570
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,504
I'm coming right now!

571
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,172
This is Yeom Haesang,
an expert on cultural assets

572
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,758
and a professor from Jeyoung University's
Department of Folklore.

573
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,885
Thank you for coming.
Please take a look at that.

574
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,224
[landlore]
Gosh, we don't have time for this.

575
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,477
How could that rock be a cultural asset?

576
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,396
[Haesang]
It's not a rock but a cornerstone.

577
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,731
It differs in size from one that belongs
to a palace or a luxurious <i>hanok.</i>

578
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,526
It was made from mountain stone,

579
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,987
so it looks to be from a thatched house
belonging to the lower class.

580
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,655
Is it from the Joseon Dynasty?

581
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,739
Yes.

582
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,535
So what? Should we stop construction
just because of this?

583
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:05,454
No, you can continue
after we get a photo of it.

584
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,208
The cornerstone is crude
and the base was built carelessly.

585
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,002
It has no value as a cultural asset.

586
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,045
That's good.

587
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,338
[landlore sighs]

588
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:18,217
However, it would be best to hold
a rite before anything.

589
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,386
- A rite?
- Here he goes again.

590
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,931
[official] Professor, if that's all,
you should go now.

591
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,560
The foul-smelling black soil over there
used to be an outhouse.

592
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,813
The Kitchen Goddess, who is in charge
of the furnace, is good-natured,

593
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:31,939
but the Outhouse Goddess is different.

594
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,483
She is a scary ghost
with a violent personality.

595
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,277
[laughs]
That can't be the reason

596
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,905
why you're telling us
to hold a rite, right?

They've watched over this land
for hundreds of years.

00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,756
- [landlore] What is he talking about?
- [official] Well...

602
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,840
Let's talk.

603
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,759
[landlore] We have to hold a rite
before resuming construction?

604
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:02,053
- [official] He's a very unique person--
- [landlore] Why would he say that?

605
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,763
Fine, let's talk.

You're a folklore professor?

608
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,521
- Yes.
- Do all folklore professors

609
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,815
do this kind of thing?

610
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,486
We do this, give lectures,
and work on research as well.

611
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,075
You knew my father, right?

612
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:25,868
No.

613
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,872
Then why did you come to the funeral?

Bigger? What got bigger?

617
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,513

People you don't like
or you wish would disappear will die.

Evil spirits are said to grow
by fulfilling a person's desires.

what you're talking about.

It's not a new type of fraud.

00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,009
Whatever.

631
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,346
I don't have any money for an exorcism
so find someone else.

Unless if it's to call a chauffeur.

648

This rhythm is mainly played
by an instrumental ensemble.

It's the morning after we came back

She stayed up late that night studying

and fell asleep in her room, at home.

715
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,294
Yes, that's right.
I was home that morning.

People you don't like

By the way, why are you

Current forensic techniques

00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,927
there are still cases

00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,555
that are hard to solve

00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,061
- Where is it?
- [Semi] Hey, in here.

890
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,397
Come on in.

891
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,025
[Sanyeong]
But what do you mean, there's a ghost?

892
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,027
[Semi sighs]

893
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,446
- A ghost of a little girl?
- [Semi] Yes.

894
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,449
The corner store lady asked if I was okay.

895
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:26,203
She used to hear a little girl crying
in this house whenever it was nighttime.

896
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,663
A little girl must have lived here.

897
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,750
The previous tenants
only had a son in middle school.

898
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,087
Is it ghost season? Everyone is talking
about ghosts wherever I go.

899
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:39,007
Hey, it's not a joke. I'm being serious.

900
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,176
I hear people whispering
and mumbling every night

901
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,844
and footsteps too.

902
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,596
It's sad enough that I don't have money,

903
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,556
but do I really have to live
in a haunted house?

904
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,724
- [loud thud]
- [gasps]

905
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,770
[Semi] See?

906
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:54,231
The light does that every time
the door closes upstairs.

907
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,107
The lightbulb is broken.
Hurry up and change it.

908
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,652
- Hey, you...
- I'll change it for you. 20,000 won.

00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,028
- Hey!

910
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:03,073
Make sure you frequently check
the location-sharing app.

911
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,783
If I haven't moved from my house,

912
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,118
it means a ghost took me,
so make sure to come to save me.

913
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,579
All right, don't worry.

914
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,164
Let's eat.

915
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,166
Let's eat.

916
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,085
- Try it.
- Thank you for the meal.

917
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,340
[exclaims]
No way.

918
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,468
So the dad you thought was dead was alive

919
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,761
but then he died?

920
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,514
[exclaims]

921
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,600
Hey, you should go and get that keepsake.

922
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,561
You don't know what it's worth.
You said he had a nice house.

923
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,610
So does that mean you get the house

924
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,195
when your grandmother passes away?

925
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,783
Hey! Don't say such a ridiculous thing.

926
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,244
Is it?

927
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,289
[exclaims]

928
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,915
I still don't understand.

929
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,251
Why did your mother get divorced?

930
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,503
He was from a rich family
and was a university professor.

931
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,588
What was the problem?

932
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,549
I don't know.

933
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,969
I'm tired. Let's sleep.

What's going on? It's the wrong house!

962
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,288
They said it was that house!

Darn it.

964
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:42,041
This must be where he used to live.

Hey, you said you asked people
from his previous school.

966

Darn it! We're going to be mistaken
for hidden camera offenders.

Let's go back for now.

[Sanyeong] We were sleeping

It's true.

00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:47,607
Do you have a physical description?
Did you see their faces?

987

I didn't see their faces,
but they looked like middle schoolers.

Is there really no way to catch them?

What's going on?

Did someone get on?

1071
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,400
It's better if you don't know.

About what you said before.

1083
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,725
You said people could die...

1084
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,604
because of me.

1085
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,107
[Sanyeong] Can you tell me more about it?

1086
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,568
You said you didn't believe in ghosts.

1087
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,444
I don't.

1088
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,488
I don't believe in them, but...

1089
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,329
Never mind.

1090
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:36,664
Tell me.

[♪ pensive music]

1092
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,169
Tell me what happened.

1093
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:50,720
Two people...

1094
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,556
around me died.

1095
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,684
The voice phishing offender
who took all of our money

1096
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:59,061
and a young kid.

What?

1100
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,870
It's the same size.

1101
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,665
You said two people died?

1102
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,209
Can I see photos of them?

1103
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,295
Why do you want their photos?

1104
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,465
[Sanyeong] His name was Kim Jinwook.

1105
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:29,508
He attended a nearby middle school.

1106
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:32,970
It's this way.

1107
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:36,766

That's him.

1111
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,799
You said he fell down a flight of stairs?

1112
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:12,426
He didn't simply die from falling.
A ghost did this.

1113
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:18,766
So are you saying this is because of me?

1114
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,812
No, it's a different ghost.

1115
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:24,855
There's another ghost like this?

1116
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:28,359
Many different things exist
in this world alongside us.

1117
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:31,320
As numerous as the beliefs or fears

1118
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,573
that each person has.

You guys are

Jung Heetae and Gil Sunghyun

No, we weren't.

1135
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:37,344
What do you mean, "no"?
I saw you guys with my own two eyes.

1136
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,847
We went our separate ways
after you chased us.

We really don't know how Jinwook died.

[Sanyeong] But it was you guys.

1139

What about the other kid? Where is he?

01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:49,231
[Heetae] Other kid?

Who are you talking about?

1142
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,487
There were four of you.

1143
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,113
What was it,

1144
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,742
the hand with "4237" on it?

1145
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:02,870

[Sunghyun] How do you know that?

1149
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,884
I know because I saw it

took photos with your cell phones.

[Sanyeong]
It doesn't make sense to go back now.

You said they might die.

You should go home.

After I figure out
what kind of ghost it is,

1166
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,474
[Haesang] I'll have to think of something.

That kid dying...

1170
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:15,609

No, it doesn't.

What do you do if it really turns out

1180
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:51,896
to be an actual ghost?

1181
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:55,316
Do I throw salt or green onions at it?

1182
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:59,403
You listen to them and learn their names
and the reason why they're still here.

1183
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,114
How can I listen to what they say
if I can't see them?

- Also, be careful around doors.
- Doors?

The worlds inside
and outside a door are different.

1186

[Haesang] Doors are the passageways
that connect those worlds.

If someone knocks
on the outside of a door,

1188

1241
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,593
[knocking on door]

1242
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:10,803
Is anyone there?

1244
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:17,393

[doorbell rings]

1247
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,040
Where is the cell phone?

1248
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:43,669
Over there, on the bed.

1249
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:51,260
I keep getting calls

1250
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:54,638
from Hyunwoo, who is dead.
[sniffles]

1251
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:57,349
Are you sure Hyunwoo is dead?

1252
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,559
Definitely.

1253
01:13:58,642 --> 01:13:59,935
What does he say...

1254
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:02,646
when he calls?

1255
01:14:03,814 --> 01:14:05,399
A little girl cries...

1256
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:08,902
without saying anything.

1257
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:10,112

Excuse me. May I speak with you?

1260

The people living in Unit 101...

[♪ eerie music]

1265
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,031
The door.

1266
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:00,746
[Haesang] <i>The worlds inside
and outside a door are different.</i>

1267
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:04,166
<i>Doors are the passageways
that connect those worlds.</i>

1268
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:06,251
[♪ music intensifies]

1269
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:23,393

{\an8}SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM SUNGKYU

1278
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:07,604
[♪ closing theme music]

1279
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:26,456
{\an8}[Sanyeong] <i>The dead kid used to talk about
a younger sibling.</i>

1280
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,041
{\an8}[Haesang] <i>Not for you.</i>

1281
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,835
{\an8}The evil spirit is still possessing you.

1282
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:32,045
{\an8}No. There's no such thing as ghosts.

1283
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,964
{\an8}[Hongsae] <i>You think Gu Sanyeong
is the culprit?</i>

1284
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:35,841
{\an8}It's the same for these cases.

1285
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,969
{\an8}[Munchun] <i>There were red bruises
on the victim's wrists.</i>

1286
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:42,055
{\an8}There have been
similar cases for a long time now.

1287
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,975
{\an8}[Haesang] <i>Has Ms. Sanyeong
touched anything ominous recently?</i>

1288
01:16:45,058 --> 01:16:47,644
{\an8}Are you perhaps
referring to the red hair accessory?

1289
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:48,812
{\an8}A red hair accessory?

1290
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:51,523
{\an8}[Sanyeong] <i>"The shadow with flowing hair</i>

1291
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,109
{\an8}<i>indulges humans in their desires</i>

1292
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:56,987
{\an8}<i>and grows in size."</i>
